if you have an string then hashCode for the string is generated as like below 

String str="Code" 

then its hashCode is generated as like below :
    firstly this string converted to the char array then after that suppose array is a 
    and n is the length of the string...
   
     a[0]*31^(n-1) + a[1]*31^(n-2) + a[2]*31^(n-3) 
      
       and then total sum of this gives you the hashcode
