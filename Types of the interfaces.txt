There are 3 types of the interfaces:
1) Normal Interface
2) Functional Interface or SAM "Single Abstract Method " interface 
3) Marker interface 

  Let's just consider about interface only have the abstract methods in it and nothing more than that 
so 
1) Noraml Interface is the interface which has more than 1 methods(abstract).
2) Functional Interface is the interdface which has only the "single" abstract method in it.
3) Marker Interface : is the interface which doesn't had any type of the interface 
                      so this interface is mainly used for the giving the message to the JVM that this particular class
                      which implements this interface have the special Previledges to it .
   For example : Serializable is the interface which gives the info to the compiler that this particular class that implements 
                  the Serializable interface has special previledges that this particular  class's object will be 
                   convertible to the "stram of bytes".
