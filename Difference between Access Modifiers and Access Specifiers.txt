Difference Between Access Specifiers and Access Modifiers
The meaning of both the access specifiers and the access modifiers is the same. 
There are no differences between the specifiers and modifiers, and the use of both is the same. 
The access modifier is an official term and the new term that we use instead of modifier is specifier.

So, default, public, protected, and private access modifiers can also be referred 
           to as default, public, protected, and private access specifiers.
