Priorities methods in Java :
    priority is nothing but the number which tells the JVM that 
    when allocates the process basically the thread which has the higher priority will allocates the 
    processor first as compared to the thread which allocates the processor later...
    
    Priorities are from the 1 to 10 
        there is no priority like 0 ,-1 ,11 like that 
            if you specified the invalid priority then that results into the Runtime Exception 
            as the "IllegalArgumentException" 
            
as we have mainly 2 methods for the priorities 
1) getPriority 
2) setPriority
 
Note: By default priority setted by the JVM to the main thread is 5 
      so here for example inheritance rule also applies as the thrad which we create from the 
      main thread has the bydefault priority is same as the main thread ...
      
      And the another thing to note is that there is no restrictions on when you are setting your 
      priorities like it is also allowed after the thread start i.e after the start() method as well
