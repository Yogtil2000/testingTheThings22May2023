/*
Command line Argument in Java are the arguments which are passed to the JAVA program at the runtime 
    and these arguments are passed from the console at the time of the runtime 
         so when we compile a program 
         like 
            javac Main.java 
               
               
                but at the time of the runtime we need to pass the arguments 
                     these arguments are stored in the form of the String array 
                        and we can convert them into accordance of our need like in int float boolean 
                             as they are in String format by default 
                                 
                                 like java Main Hello World What are you doing right now ........
                                 
                                 
                                   so in this way we are providing the command line arguments through
                                      the console to the main method 
                                           
                                           
                                           and we can access them as using the indexing of the array 
                                           
                                           
M IMP:  when command line arguments supplied to the JVM , JVM wraps these arguments and passed args[] array 
         and we can access it using the args[0] , args[1]  like that 
              
     Compiling and Running the Program :
     
    comipling------>     javac Main.java 
         
      Running -----> java Main Hello World What world doing right now ??????
      
      so here at the run time we passed the arguments like Hello -- World --What --World--doing--right--now
