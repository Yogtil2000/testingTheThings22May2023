Daemon Thread in java :
     This is the thread which runs behind the scenes or it can be run at the background 
     of the main thread so due to this this thread helps to the main thread by providing the services
     to the main thread.
     
 REM*- You always need to set the Daemon Thread before the actual start() to the thread 
       If you set the Daemon thread to that particular thread as after the start() 
       then you get the Runtime Exception as : "IllegalThreadStateException" 
       
       Life of Daemon Theread :
           life of the Daemon thread is depends on the life of the Thread to which it provides the service
           
      Daemon Thread Nature :
           It inherits the nature/ properties from its parent thread.
           
           Priorities are same of both the parent and child.
           
    JVM role in Daemon Thread :
         basically JVM works till normal threads present ,
              but bychance if there is only the Daemon Thread is working 
              then JVM kills the Daemon Thread and then JVM shuts down.
              
              So JVM doesn't dependent on the Daemon Thread.
              
    * Most of the times "Daemon thread" has the "low priority" but we can change its priority 
    according to our needs.
    
    One of the most important things related to this is that can we make the main thread() as 
    the Deamon thread ------> NO 
    because : start() METHOD FOR THE MAIN METHOD IS INVOKED BY THE JVM ALREADY AND IF NOW 
              YOU ARE TRIED FOR THE setDaemon(true) then at that time it will gives you the 
              Runtime Exception : "IllegalThreadStateException" 
              
              "IllegalThreadStateException"---------------------
